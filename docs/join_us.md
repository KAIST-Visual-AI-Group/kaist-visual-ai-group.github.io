## Join Our Group!

### Introduction to the KAIST Visual AI Group

In our group, we mainly research machine learning technologies for visual data. We currently focus on three main research topics (while not limited to these, we explore a wider range related to them):

- Generative models
- 3D/geometry representations
- Foundation models

Please check out our recent publications [**here**](../publications/){:target="_blank}. We actively publish papers in the following top-tier conferences in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics:

- ML: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR
- CV: CVPR, ICCV, ECCV
- CG: SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia

**We’re building a strong team! In 2024, all our graduate students have published papers as first authors in the aforementioned top-tier conferences.** Beyond just publishing papers, our ultimate goal is to create technologies that can change the world.

###Openings

#### International Applicants
For international applicants, we have special openings with no limitations on the available slots. Please [**contact**](../contact/){:target="_blank} us before applying for the Master’s program.

#### Korean Applicants
For Korean applicants, we currently have year-round openings (for both Spring and Fall) for:

- Two government-funded School of Computing Master's students,
- One KAIST scholarship School of Computing Master's student,
- One KAIST scholarship AI Graduate School  Master's student, and
- One Metaverse Graduate School Master's student

Using the KAIST scholarship openings is exceptional. To join our group, we recommend applying for the government-funded School of Computing Master's program or [**contacting**](../contact/){:target="_blank} us before applying.

#### Spring vs. Fall Admissions
During the Fall admissions, only remaining openings that were not filled during the Spring admissions can be used. Therefore, we recommend applying in the Spring admissions. The likelihood of having openings for Fall applicants is low. If you must apply for the Fall admissions, please [**contact**](../contact/){:target="_blank} us by the summer (August) of the previous year.

If you have questions about which openings would be best to apply for, please reach out to us.


### Recruiting Criteria

**We recruit Master’s students who are willing to pursue a Ph.D. in our group.** Students who have demonstrated strong performance through internships in our group will be given priority; however, we do not automatically select all students who have interned with us. Currently, approximately 30% of our graduate students joined without having interned in the group. Next, we prioritize students who have performed well in our courses. You can check the avaigrouple courses on my website.

We consider the following aspects: (* number: Importance)

- **Motivation (\*\*\*)**: Your reasons for wanting to conduct research in our group and the kind of research you wish to pursue.
- **Knowledge (\*\*)**: Relevant courses taken and grades received, or level of related knowledge, including:
    - Linear algebra, probability and statistics, optimization, discrete mathematics, etc.
    - Computer graphics, computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, etc.
- **Programming Skills (\*\*)**: Experience with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Python, C++, etc.
- **English Skills (\*)**: The group's weekly meetings are conducted in English. Research achievements are published in English papers, which must also be presented in English. Colgrouporation with individuals from various countries is common during the research process.
- **GPA (\*)**: Overall GPA and grades in relevant courses.
- **Experience (\*)**: Participation in related research projects and internships, particularly in our group.


### Recruiting Process

- Please do not send a contact email without any questions. Note that our recruiting process begins after the university's admission decision.

- If you are curious about which openings would be best for you to apply for, or how many openings remain for late admissions, please [**contact**](../contact/){:target="_blank} us.

- When applying to our group, you will be asked to submit your KAIST graduate school application, transcript, and CV. Please ensure you have these documents prepared.

- **If you are interested in our group, we highly recommend applying for an internship in our group first.**


### Internships in Our Group

We recruit undergraduate interns every summer and winter. Please check out the internship information [**here**](../internship/){:target="_blank}
